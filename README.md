LUCTHELEO WebsiteThis repository contains the files for the official LUCTHELEO website. It is designed to be simple, elegant, and easy to update.File Structureindex.html: The main website file. It contains all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to display and run the site. You should not need to edit this file.content.json: Your website's "database." This file contains all the text, embeds, and links that appear dynamically on your site. This is the only file you need to edit to add or change content.How to View Your Website LocallyWhen you open index.html directly in a browser from your computer, you may see an error related to "fetch". This is a standard security feature in browsers. To view the site correctly, you need to run it through a simple local server. The easiest way to do this is with the Live Server extension in VS Code.Install the Extension: In VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey. Click Install.Open Your Project: Open the folder containing your index.html and content.json files in VS Code.Go Live: Right-click on the index.html file in the Explorer panel and select "Open with Live Server". Your website will automatically open in your default browser and will work perfectly.How to Add New ContentAdding new content is as simple as adding a new entry to the content.json file.Open content.json in VS Code.Copy an existing post block. For example, to add a new "INKLING" post, you could copy the CRCLT_02 - INKLING block.Paste it at the end of the list (before the closing ]).Change the details:Update the "id" to your new title (e.g., "CRCLT_03 - NEW THOUGHT").Update the "content" with your new text or embed code.Save the file. If you are using Live Server, the website will update automatically.Example: Adding a New INKLINGYou would add the following block to the content.json file. Remember to add a comma after the previous entry!    },
    {
        "id": "FRQNCY_01 - OBSERVATION",
        "type": "post",
