- Brand presentation and style development
- Color palettes, typography, overall visual language

### JS Function (Market Operation)
How you operate and connect with audiences

## Creative Block Resolution

Our systematic approach enables precise identification of where creative development stalls:

### Core Identity Blocks (HTML Issues)
When authentic creative message feels unclear or purpose seems uncertain. Resolved through core identity clarification and systematic foundation work.

### Presentation Blocks (CSS Issues)  
When visual choices feel overwhelming or aesthetic direction seems unclear. Resolved through systematic aesthetic development and decision-making frameworks.

### Operational Blocks (JS Issues)
When market connection feels challenging or audience engagement creates anxiety. Resolved through systematic operational development and market interface optimization.

### Recovery Process
Rather than general creative advice, our framework pinpoints exactly where development has stalled, enabling targeted resolution and continued progress.
